# backend/api/routers/definitions_router

This file contains the routing to all individual definition sub-routers, such
as panel templates, etc.

## Remarks

Currently, the only definitions sub-router is that for the panel templates.
However, as Smorgasboard evolves, all definition sub-routers will be routed
through this one (`/definitions/another-router`/).
